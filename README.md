# Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generator
A Python program that implements and demonstrates the famous Collatz conjecture (also known as the 3n+1 problem). This mathematical conjecture states that for any positive integer, repeatedly applying a specific set of operations will eventually lead to the number 1.

## The Collatz Conjecture:
The algorithm follows these simple rules:
- If the number is even: divide it by 2 (n // 2).
- If the number is odd: multiply by 3 and add 1 (3n + 1).
- Repeat until the sequence reaches 1.
